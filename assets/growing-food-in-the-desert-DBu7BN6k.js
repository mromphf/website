As a child of a moderate Catholic family and student in a Catholic school system, there was always a copy within reach. It was the <em>Bible.</em> It was important, even sacred, and that was enough for me. It was also intimidating and boring. I can’t recall a moment when I picked it up on purpose and read it out of curiosity.</p><p>Here’s what I knew for sure was in the Bible: <em>“Let there be light”</em>, Adam, Eve, Garden, Snake, Cain, Abel, Abraham, Noah, Ark, Flood, Moses, Plagues, Red Sea, Ten Commandments, something called “The Psalms”, Matthew, Mark, Luke, John, Mary, Angel, Bethlehem, Stable, Wise Men, Frankincense and Myrrh (whatever that is), John the Baptist, Jesus, Miracles, Good Samaritan, Golden Rule, Judas, Pontius Pilate, Crucifixion, Resurrection, Ascension.</p><p>That’s <em>maybe</em> 15% of the text. Surely I was exposed to more scripture during <a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/mass-Christian-religious-service">Mass</a> and Christian Ethics class (<em>snore</em>), but I was impervious. My mind was on Super Nintendo. Of the historic, cultural, and geographic characteristics of the Bible I could tell you nothing. I knew there were a lot of sandals and donkeys, and that washing people’s feet was a significant gesture. I knew people back then were into writing letters, especially to the Romans and someone called the “<a href="https://www.britannica.com/place/Corinth-Greece">Corinthians</a>.” In terms of Bible lore, that’s pitiful. Perhaps you can relate? For instance, I’m confident you could recite at least three of the Ten Commandments, maybe even five, but did you know that there are several variations of the Commandments in the Bible? (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Exodus%2020%3A1-17&amp;version=NIV">Exodus 20:1-17</a>, <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Deuteronomy%205%3A6%E2%80%9321&amp;version=NIV">Deuteronomy 5:6–21</a>, <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Exodus%2034%3A10%E2%80%9328&amp;version=NIV">Exodus 34:10-28</a>)</p><p>There are many ways to read the Bible, and not all of them demand credulity. Through an anthropological lens, we could consider the text as a reflection of early era Near Eastern agriculture. Try this. If I asked you to pick out the five most common professions mentioned, would your list include farmer, fisher, or shepherd? What food comes to mind? Bread? Olives? Figs? Goat? Fish? Wine? The Ten Commandments explicitly forbid the coveting of your neighbour’s ox or donkey (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Exodus%2020%3A17&amp;version=NIV">see no. 10</a>), as well as offer an inducement involving land (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Exodus%2020%3A12&amp;version=NIV">see no. 4</a>) The liberated <a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/Hebrew">Hebrew</a> slaves were promised a <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Exodus%203%3A8&amp;version=NIV">land</a> flowing with milk and honey. Jesus told parables of the sower, the weeds, and the mustard seed. There’s a table of weights and measurements in the back, with equivalent units for pounds, bushels, and quarts. The authors write extensively about agrarian societies, with recurring definitions, assessments, and variations of agricultural laws and customs.</p><p>Instead of trying to substantiate or rebuke the text’s authenticity as the revelatory ethical framework of a post-void self-creating supercreator, let’s think of it in terms of people. Let’s think about a world where most travellers had to walk to where they’re trying to go. A world of floods, locusts, and imperial oppression, where a lost animal or failed crop could be a matter of life and death.</p><h3>Structure</h3><p>Most people know the Bible is divided into two distinct works called the <a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/Old-Testament">Old Testament</a> and the <a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/New-Testament">New Testament</a>. The Old Testament is substantially longer, with the New Testament beginning around page 800 (of about a 1000) in the New International Version. The Old was originally written down (long following the oral tradition) in Biblical Hebrew languages with splashes of Aramaic, while the New would’ve been first recorded in dialects of Greek. But the primary differentiating factor is Jesus Christ. Everything in the New Testament orbits the life and preaching of Jesus Christ, the Son of God. His place in the Old Testament is more complex and ambiguous. Theologians, scholars, and historians have worked for millenia to identify allusions and references to <a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/Christ#word-history">Christ</a> within the Hebrew prophecies, but he is never mentioned by name.</p><p>Both Testaments are composed of smaller books; Genesis, Leviticus, Psalms, Romans, etc. In a Biblical context, a “book” is not how we think about it in a library: pages bound and glued to a spine, with a marketable front cover. These texts, first shared orally, would’ve been recorded on parchment scrolls or other proto-paper. The assembly of these documents into the Bible we now know occurred long after the events recorded.</p><p>The structure of the New Testament is straightforward. The first four books, the <a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/Gospel-New-Testament">gospels</a>, depict the birth, career, death, and resurrection of Jesus according to the accounts of Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John. The rest of the books, at a high level, are composed of letters, messages, notices, and advisories dedicated to the evangelization of what was becoming Christianity. The Testament closes with Revelation, an apocalyptic work reasserting God’s <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Revelation%2011%3A15&amp;version=NIV">dominion</a> over creation and establishing the inevitable <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Revelation%2022%3A12&amp;version=NIV">second coming</a> of Christ, which will <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Revelation%2021%3A1&amp;version=NIV">conclude humankind’s career</a> on Earth and <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Revelation%2021%3A3-4&amp;version=NIV">unite Christians with God</a> in the Holy Kingdom.</p><p>The Old Testament is not overtly Christian, but Biblical scholars and theologians retroactively superimpose and integrate Christian identities into the text through rigorous reinterpretation. The Old Testament also exists in the form of the <a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/Hebrew-Bible">Hebrew Bible</a>, the precursor Jewish text that Christians incorporated in the Holy Bible with minor structural differences. Itself divided into distinct collections and layers, in many ways it is the story and belief system of the Hebrew people. The first five books: Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, and Deuteronomy, form the <a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/Torah">Torah</a>, which might be thought of as the <em>Very Old Testament</em>. The Torah, functioning well as a mythology, depicts many of the characters and stories you’d recognize: Adam and Eve, Cain and Abel, Abraham, Noah, Moses. This is the foundation of the Abrahamic tradition, upon which the Hebrews (later, Jews and Christians) built their religions. It’s useful to think of the Hebrews not as a monolithic ethnic group but as a collective identity shared by nomadic Near Eastern tribes who observed the Abrahamic culture, history, and prophecies. The Old Testament could then be read as an account of Hebrew life across the millennium preceding the birth of Jesus, and their understanding of the world they occupied and their place in it.</p><h3>World</h3><p>Earth has a continent-spanning belt of arid climate stretching from the Western Sahara to Mongolia. On a globe, what we now call the <a href="https://www.britannica.com/place/Near-East">Near East</a> sits roughly between these points, on the East Coast of the Mediterranean Sea, unfolding towards Mesopotamia, Egypt, Persia, and Anatolia. Summers are hot and dry, lousy with dust, haze, sandstorms, prolonged droughts and heat waves. The Lebanon and Zagros Mountains shelter valleys and plains, drawing settlers to fertile soil. Ranchers kept sheep, goats, donkeys, cattle, and dogs. Wandering the wilderness posed the risk of encountering a lion or wolf. Snakes and scorpions waited in the thistles, often venomous. Greece, Egypt, and Persia were developing civilizations and mythologies that would become foundational, later to crumble. This is the Biblical World.</p><p>At the time of Jesus’s birth, the Jews of Palestine were struggling under Roman oppression and eager for a Messiah. The client-king <a href="https://www.britannica.com/biography/Herod-king-of-Judaea">Herod</a> placed a heavy tax burden on the rural peasants to fund his palaces and public projects, hanging Pagan symbols above the entrance to the Jerusalem Temple. Herod’s death around 4 BCE plunged Palestine into unrest. As a young Jesus may have been finding his feet in Nazareth, Jewish rebels mounted an attack on the Roman garrison in the nearby city of Sepphoris, destroying their armory and weapons. In retribution, Caesar’s Legionaries marched on the uprising, torched the city, and crucified the rebels.</p><p>Late contrarian <a href="https://www.britannica.com/biography/Christopher-Hitchens">Christopher Hitchens</a> posited the Old Testament’s supposed warrant for “<em>trafficking in humans, for ethnic cleansing, for slavery, for bride price, and indiscriminate massacre</em>” as evidence for its ethical bankruptcy. Though these themes are overtly present within the text and are worthy of close examination, Hitchens in his critique described the Hebrews as “<em>crude, uncultured human mammals.”</em> This disparaging, incurious designation is an impoverished basis for discussing the people who created and propagated one of the world’s lasting belief systems. The Hebrews were not rich and powerful, nor did they have access to the Periodic Table of Elements, Calculus, or the Printing Press. Nevertheless they built temples with tools of wood and stone, wrote prophecies, grew food in the desert, with a vibrant culture of stories, music, and poems. They were downtrodden and outcast people who survived in a climate of floods, hail, imperialism, and scorched earth.</p><h3>God</h3><p>Who is God and what does he look like? That’s a tough one, considering the variety of his manifestations across the Bible. His reputation precedes him, especially regarding his early days. The ever-delightful <a href="https://www.britannica.com/biography/Richard-Dawkins">Professor Dawkins</a> describes the Old Testament god as “<em>arguably the most unpleasant character in all fiction: jealous and proud of it; a petty, unjust, unforgiving control-freak; a vindictive, bloodthirsty ethnic cleanser; a misogynistic, homophobic, racist, infanticidal, genocidal, filicidal, pestilential, megalomaniacal, sadomasochistic, capriciously malevolent bully.</em>” A bit polemic for our purposes. Perhaps we could reassess this entity through a lens more adjacent to people and the ancient world.</p><p>After arranging the cosmos, the first thing God does is plant a garden. “The Lord God made all kinds of trees grow out of the ground—trees that were pleasing to the eye and good for food.” (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Genesis%202%3A9&amp;version=NIV">Genesis 2:9</a>) The first instruction he issues is explicitly about food: “You are free to eat from any tree in the garden; but you must not eat from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, for when you eat from it you will certainly die.” (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Genesis%202%3A16-17&amp;version=NIV">Genesis 2:16-17</a>) The theme continues beyond Eden. In the fourth chapter, “Abel kept flocks, and Cain worked the soil.” (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Genesis%204%3A2&amp;version=NIV">Genesis 4:2</a>) Offering a portion of your crops to someone in your community becomes a gesture of generosity or devotion: “In the course of time Cain brought some of the fruits of the soil as an offering to the Lord”. (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Genesis%204%3A3&amp;version=NIV">Genesis 4:3</a>)</p><p>Old Testament life becomes more distressing several chapters later. Good weather can turn ferocious with little warning. “The Lord regretted that he had made human beings on the earth, and his heart was deeply troubled. So the Lord said, “I will wipe from the face of the earth the human race I have created—and with them the animals, the birds and the creatures that move along the ground—for I regret that I have made them.” (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Genesis%206%3A7&amp;version=NIV">Genesis 6:7</a>)</p><p>In the Biblical World, a flash flood can obliterate your village in a single verse: “Every living thing that moved on land perished - birds, livestock, wild animals, all the creatures that swarm over the earth, and all mankind. ” (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Genesis%207%3A21&amp;version=NIV">Genesis 7:21</a>) You’re especially vulnerable if you built on a shore, especially in a prolonged period of drought. Black rainclouds crawl over the mountains, like the hand of God, and dump a hurricane on you. God sneezes and a tsunami erases your boats and fishing supplies, sweeps away your sheep, spoils the food you stored underground. Surviving farmers may be inclined to issue a heavenly appeal. What sacrifice is worth placating one so temperamental?</p><p>In Exodus, the God of Abraham reveals himself to Moses in the form of fire. “There the angel of the Lord appeared to him in flames of fire from within a bush. Moses saw that though the bush was on fire it did not burn up.” (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Exodus%203%3A2&amp;version=NIV">Exodus 3:2</a>) Forest fires can incinerate wildlife, countryside, livestock, and villages with incomprehensible speed. Walls of fire consume the horizon, columns of ash and dust and smoke drift over continents like the plague of darkness: “Stretch out your hand toward the sky so that darkness spreads over Egypt—darkness that can be felt.” (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Exodus%2010%3A21&amp;version=NIV">Exodus 10:21</a>) As with the floods, God is an elemental force. “Mount Sinai was covered with smoke, because the Lord descended on it in fire. The smoke billowed up from it like smoke from a furnace, and the whole mountain trembled violently.” (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Exodus%2019%3A18&amp;version=NIV">Exodus 19:18</a>) If a shepherd beheld a wall of fire as tall as the sky, would they see the face of God?</p><p>Notice how Old Testament English translations refer to God as “Lord” or “The Lord”? The idea that the Biblical God has no proper name like Odin, Hades, or Ra is a misconception. Behold the Tetragrammaton: <a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/Yahweh">YHWH</a>. To the Hebrews, this is God’s name. This representation omits vowels, but if you try to sound it out you’ve probably heard this before. The ancient Israelites considered speaking the name irreverent. As a tribute to the desert tribes, we’ll exclude the name here. Instead the Hebrews would substitute the name with <a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/Adonai"><em>Adonai</em></a><em>:</em> Lord.</p><p>To break the Pharaoh and secure the Hebrew’s liberation, the Lord unleashes plagues that would have devastated an agricultural society. Gnats, locusts, drought, livestock diseases, hail. What force is this that makes a joke of the Egyptian gods? “If you refuse to let them go and continue to hold them back, the hand of the Lord will bring a terrible plague on your livestock in the field—on your horses, donkeys and camels and on your cattle, sheep and goats.” (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Exodus%209%3A2-3&amp;version=NIV">Exodus 9:2-3</a>) What use are riches and weapons when your people are freezing and hungry in the dark?</p><h3>Jesus</h3><p>Christians refer to him as Jesus Christ. Historians usually go with Jesus of <a href="https://www.britannica.com/place/Nazareth-Israel">Nazareth</a>, sometimes the Nazarene. The academic consensus is that he was <a href="https://www.britannica.com/biography/Jesus">real</a>, that he was from Nazareth, spoke <a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/Aramaic-language">Aramaic</a> (not Ara<em>bic</em>), and was <a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/crucifixion-capital-punishment">crucified</a> as per Roman law at the time. The rest is somewhat of an existential fill-in-the-blank, so we’ll abstain from the matter of divinity. Here we’re less concerned with Jesus Christ, Son of God, and more interested in Jesus of Nazareth, a Jewish preacher who lived in a savage climate, literate in Hebrew prophecy, surrounded by rebels fighting the Romans.</p><p>We should start by looking at how he’s commonly depicted. White, of course, with wavy shampooed hair and a combed beard. Fatherly and brotherly at the same time, with a gentle, welcoming disposition. His humble shepherd’s getup juxtaposed against his divinity. In other words, the <a href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0694293/">Robert Powell</a> portrayal.</p><p>Try to picture Jesus as he likely appeared given the time and place of his birth: brown skinned and dark haired, perhaps on the short side, struggling with dental health, with the trim build of someone who spends his time on the road and in the country.</p><p>The area around Nazareth would’ve been a rugged, semi-farmable region where clean drinking water was a pain in the ass to collect and carry home. Jesus is often referred to as a carpenter, but the more accurate term is <em>tekton</em>. This Ancient Greek word doesn’t translate to woodworker as much as it does to craftsman or artisan, but this designation confirms he was a labourer, a man who worked with clay and stone and lumber in the hot sun. While not a farmer, he and his community would have shared a dedicated effort to growing food in an environment where a sandstorm can blow your donkey off a cliff.</p><p>Jesus’s relationship to growing food is a recurring theme in his parables. “A farmer went out to sow his seed. As he was scattering the seed, some fell along the path, and the birds came and ate it up. Some fell on rocky places, where it did not have much soil. It sprang up quickly, because the soil was shallow. But when the sun came up, the plants were scorched, and they withered because they had no root. Other seed fell among thorns, which grew up and choked the plants. Still other seed fell on good soil, where it produced a crop—a hundred, sixty or thirty times what was sown.” (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew%2013%3A3-8&amp;version=NIV">Matthew 13:3-8</a>) He includes the field workers, implying the virtue of their labour. “The harvest is plentiful but the workers are few. Ask the Lord of the harvest, therefore, to send out workers into his harvest field.” (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew%209%3A37-38&amp;version=NIV">Matthew 9:37-38</a>) He is referred to and talked about as a shepherd: “For out of you will come a ruler who will shepherd my people Israel.” (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew%202%3A6&amp;version=NIV">Matthew 2:6</a>) And he touches on the maintenance of clothing: “No one sews a patch of unshrunk cloth on an old garment. Otherwise, the new piece will pull away from the old, making the tear worse.” (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Mark%202%3A21&amp;version=NIV">Mark 2:21</a>)</p><p>He incorporates the development and management of an entire vineyard: “There was a landowner who planted a vineyard. He put a wall around it, dug a winepress in it and built a watchtower. Then he rented the vineyard to some farmers and moved to another place. When the harvest time approached, he sent his servants to the tenants to collect his fruit.” (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew%2021%3A33-34&amp;version=NIV">Matthew 21:33-34</a>) Others in his repertoire include the parable of the fig tree, the net, and the yeast.</p><p>The Romans had opinions about who’s farm and who’s vineyard they could tax to dust. Jesus needed no encouragement to chastise them for this. When the <a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/Pharisee">Pharisees</a> try to pin him on his virtue by asking if the imperial tax to Caesar is worth paying, he asks whose face is on the money. ““Caesar’s,” they replied. Then he said to them, “So give back to Caesar what is Caesar’s, and to God what is God’s.” (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew%2022%3A21&amp;version=NIV">Matthew 22:21</a>)</p><p>The <a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/Temple-of-Jerusalem">Second Temple of Jerusalem</a> was a sacred cultural center of worship and commerce to the Israelites. But the shadow of Rome loomed large. The <a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/Sadducee">aristocratic priests</a> cozied up to the nobles and elites, passing along income generated from temple dues they charged pilgrims coming from across the empire. This commercialization and hypocrisy was an affront to the Jews.</p><p>The Nazarene was unhappy with this. In a rare display of violence, “Jesus entered the temple courts and began driving out those who were buying and selling there. He overturned the tables of the money changers and the benches of those selling doves, and would not allow anyone to carry merchandise through the temple courts.” (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Mark%2011%3A15-16&amp;version=NIV">Mark 11:15-16</a>). He decries ““Is it not written: ‘My house will be called a house of prayer for all nations’? But you have made it a den of robbers.”” (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Mark%2011%3A17&amp;version=NIV">Mark 11:17</a>) This was not a misdemeanour. Any disturbance at the Temple was grave civic disruption. In his rage, Jesus exposed himself to prosecution. “The chief priests and the teachers of the law heard this and began looking for a way to kill him, for they feared him, because the whole crowd was amazed at his teaching.” (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Mark%2011%3A18&amp;version=NIV">Mark 11:18</a>)</p><p><a href="https://www.britannica.com/biography/C-S-Lewis">C.S. Lewis</a> wrote “<em>[Jesus] would either be a lunatic […] or else he would be the Devil of Hell.</em>” Would he? Often remembered as composed and serene, reexamining this depiction conjures an image of the Nazarene more wild-eyed and fervent than children are taught in Sunday School. But watching his oppressors defile the site most sacred to his people, does the indignant rage of a rebel invalidate his mission?</p><p>When the high priests send a crowd armed with swords and clubs to arrest him, a composed Jesus replies “Do what you came for, friend.” (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew%2026%3A50&amp;version=NIV">Matthew 26:50</a>)</p><h3>Satan</h3><p>It would be reductive, even heretical, to say everything you know about Satan is a lie. But everything you know about Satan is almost certainly conflated with description and imagery that doesn’t necessarily appear in the Bible. The Hebrew word <em>Satan</em> translates more closely to <a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/Satan#word-history"><em>adversary</em> or <em>accuser</em></a><em>.</em> “The accuser” is an antagonistic presence in the Bible, but rarely in the context of fire and brimstone. Often <em>the satan</em> acts under permission or direction from God, playing the role of a heavenly prosecutor rather than a sadistic conductor of limitless cosmic suffering. Many Christian ideas about Satan and Hell and eternal damnation were imported from historical features separate from authorship of the Bible by centuries. And who’s responsible for that?</p><p>That would be our friends <a href="https://www.britannica.com/biography/John-Milton">Milton</a> and <a href="https://www.britannica.com/biography/Dante-Alighieri">Dante</a>. Both these poets wrote lasting depictions of Hell and damnation, but even their imagery was borrowed from a much-earlier mystery author. The <a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/Apocalypse-of-Peter"><em>Apocalypse of Peter</em></a> is a second-century writing, inspired by Hellenistic imagery of <a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/Tartarus">Tartarus</a>, depicting the author given a tour of the underworld by an angel. He witnesses elaborate tortures, including men and women standing up to their lips in a river of flame, tossed into a bottomless abyss, frozen and quiet in the dark ice. Sound familiar? This sensationalist piece was never canonized but circulated heavily in early Christian circles. The author claimed to be the apostle Peter, but there’s no evidence of this.</p><p>What does the Bible technically say about the satan? He’s in there less than you’d think, and often not as Milton and Dante describe. Even at the beginning, there’s no explicit reference to Satan or a devil in Genesis 1. The serpent is described as “more crafty than any of the wild animals the Lord God had made.” (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Genesis%203%3A1&amp;version=NIV">Genesis: 3:1)</a> Thinking about it in terms of people, again we’re dealing with a culture where venomous snakes were an every-day concern. Especially for people who worked with the ground, whose children may try to pluck fruit from the thickets.</p><p>The satan’s role as prosecutor may be best exemplified by the story of Job. “This man was blameless and upright; he feared God and shunned evil. He had seven sons and three daughters, and he owned seven thousand sheep, three thousand camels, five hundred yoke of oxen and five hundred donkeys, and had a large number of servants. He was the greatest man among all the people of the East.” (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Job%201%3A1-3&amp;version=NIV">Job 1:1-3</a>) In the prologue of Job’s story, God and his angels get together for council. Satan is invited. “One day the angels came to present themselves before the Lord, and Satan [the adversary] also came with them.” (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Job%201%3A6&amp;version=NIV">Job 1:6</a>) During the meeting, God expresses his satisfaction with Job’s virtue. The satan offers his advice.</p><p>““Does Job fear God for nothing?” Satan replied. “Have you not put a hedge around him and his household and everything he has? You have blessed the work of his hands, so that his flocks and herds are spread throughout the land. But now stretch out your hand and strike everything he has, and he will surely curse you to your face.” (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Job%201%3A9-11&amp;version=NIV">Job 1:9-11</a>)</p><p>God is intrigued. “The Lord said to Satan, “Very well, then, everything he has is in your power, but on the man himself do not lay a finger.” (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Job%201%3A12&amp;version=NIV">Job 1:12</a>) What follows is harrowing. While Job is feasting with his sons and daughters, three messengers arrive to report that <a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/Sabaean-people">Sabeans</a> plundered his oxen and donkeys, that <a href="https://www.britannica.com/place/Neo-Babylonian-Empire">Chaldean</a> raiders ran off with his camels, and that “The fire of God fell from the heavens and burned up the sheep and the servants.” (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Job%201%3A15&amp;version=NIV">Job 1:15</a>) Notice how this is God’s fire and not Satan’s. Job keeps the faith. God is impressed, but the satan has more ideas. ““Skin for skin!” Satan replied. “A man will give all he has for his own life. But now stretch out your hand and strike his flesh and bones, and he will surely curse you to your face.” (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Job%202%3A4-5&amp;version=NIV">Job 2:4-5</a>) Again, God is on board. “The Lord said to Satan, “Very well, then, he is in your hands; but you must spare his life.”” (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Job%202%3A6&amp;version=NIV">Job 2:6</a>)</p><p>After the prologue, a Job maimed by “painful sores” lies in agony surrounded by three of his friends. They engage in an extended poetic dialogue amongst themselves and God that is considered a <a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/The-Book-of-Job">masterpiece of world literature</a>. Spoiler: Job lives and is rewarded for his suffering. “After Job had prayed for his friends, the Lord restored his fortunes and gave him twice as much as he had before.” (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Job%2042%3A10&amp;version=NIV">Job 42:10</a>) All this time, the satan fades into the background, perhaps thinking “Don’t look at me, I just work here.” But the satan had a voice in God’s council, and God listened.</p><p>The satan reprises his role in the New Testament. After his baptism, “Jesus was led by the Spirit into the wilderness to be tempted by the devil.” (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew%204%3A1&amp;version=NIV">Matthew 4:1</a>) Again we can trace the etymology, the Greek <a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/devil#word-history"><em>diábolos</em></a> is a rendering of the Hebrew <em>satan:</em> accuser. Given he was led by the Spirit, this seems to be a trial to try to break Jesus, and who better to test the Son of Man than God’s finest persecutor?</p><p>The satan advises and takes orders from God, not as a fallen angel or prince of darkness, but as an accuser. His is often referred to as the “tempter,” but let’s not forget that the New Testament was first written in Greek. The Greek word for “tempter” also <a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/tempter#word-history">translates to “tester.”</a> This is not to say he is benign. In the Biblical World, encountering the satan is bad news. A trial is coming, <em>the adversary</em> is good at his job.</p><h3>Revelation</h3><p>In <a href="https://andyweirauthor.com/">Andy Weir</a>’s “<a href="https://www.isfdb.org/cgi-bin/title.cgi?1678924">The Martian</a>”, astronaut Mark Watney’s first concern after being stranded on Mars is food. And his first solution is to grow food out of the ground. Reenacting his own creation myth, the Watney character harkens back to humankind’s first enterprise: farming, and brings it to a galactic stage.</p><p>Agriculture is a precursor to everything we have become. The ability to generate a sustainable food surplus grows villages into cities. Agriculture is also difficult. We glossed over the subject of servants and slaves, but they are prominently featured in the Bible, often working the fields, often as the property of landlords.</p><p>Today, grocery stores are filled with food grown by people in places we’ll never meet or visit, under the working conditions of the meat packing plants and industrial pig farms that would’ve turned Dante pale. Locally-minded individuals may visit a farmer’s market to buy food grown closer to home, maybe by someone they’ll meet face-to-face. Or, as I usually do, pick up the small glass brick in my pocket and summon food to my house, brought to me by someone I’ll never know, prepared by people I’ll never see, made of ingredients I couldn’t name.</p><p>The Hebrews wrote of plagues, apocalyptic floods, parting seas. We’ve crawled out of a global pandemic that suffocated our elders and broke our healers. The Old Testament God returns, perturbed by the state of his garden, blowing fire across North America, erasing half the town of <a href="https://parks.canada.ca/pn-np/ab/jasper/visit/feu-alert-fire/feudeforet-jasper-wildfire/dommage-damage">Jasper, Alberta</a>, of entire portions of <a href="https://apnews.com/live/live-updates-wildfire-los-angeles-palisades">Hollywood</a>, of forests across the <a href="https://www.news-medical.net/news/20250505/Asthma-related-emergency-visits-increase-during-wildfire-smoke-events-in-Ontario.aspx?utm_source=chatgpt.com">Ontario</a> countryside. Hurricanes continue to blast <a href="https://www.britannica.com/event/Hurricane-Helene">Florida</a> and the rest of the <a href="https://www.weather.gov/tbw/HurricaneDebby2024">East Coast</a>, drowning communities, devastating infrastructure. Water rises like the Flood as the northern ice fields melt away, pulling <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/05/04/travel/venice-sinking-scientist-pumping-water-lagoon">Venice</a> and <a href="https://www.vox.com/22295302/why-jakarta-sinking-flooding-colonialism">Jakarta</a> and <a href="https://www.bangkokpost.com/thailand/general/2499786/bangkok-is-still-sinking-and-fast-">Bangkok</a> into the sea.</p><p>Christianity has grown from its origins as a radical underground movement into one the world’s most practiced religions. The Torah and the Old Testament prophecies told and shared by the Hebrew tribes retain their exalted and profound status. These texts were written by people who grew their food from the ground with tools made of stone and wood. Our tools have come a long way, but our mouths are many and the money changers in the temple are filling their pockets with the pennies of the poor.</p><p>If the Nazarene returned, would he be surprised by what he saw?</p><hr><h3>References</h3><ul><li><a href="https://www.britannica.com/">Encyclopedia Britannica</a></li><li><em>The Holy Bible: New International Version</em> as provided by <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/">Bible Gateway</a></li><li>Belt, Don. “Life and Time.” <em>National Geographic,</em> June 2021</li><li>Christopher Hitchens: <em>God is Not Great: How Religion Poisons Everything.</em> (Emblem, 2008) pg. 102</li><li>Scott G.
