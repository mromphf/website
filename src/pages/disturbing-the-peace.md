On Friday evening Chuck Boulevard took two aspirin and sat down to read. Then the noise began. Seconds after he’d thrown the recliner back and spread a blanket over his lap, elephant feet started thumping the ceiling. His chair trembled. His steaming teacup rattled on its coaster.

He set his Orwell book aside and reached for his cane.

“I’ll knock her teeth out.”

He hobbled to the door on arthritic knees. Before stepping into the hall he considered his outfit. Flannel pajamas. It was fall in Saskatchewan.

He trekked across the apartment to his bedroom, where he surrendered his robe and slippers. On his tenth birthday he helped his dad push the car out of the snow on Highway Eleven. On his twenty-second birthday he was arrested at a Vietnam protest in Idaho. Then he was an old man and putting on a pair of slacks became a five-minute process. He had to sit on the edge of the bed to yank each leg up while pandemonium roared overhead.

He buttoned a collared shirt and pulled his scarecrow arms into a cardigan. He appraised his reflection. A serious person.

There was a sign taped to the hallway elevator: Out of Order. Repairman coming tomorrow. The sign had been hanging all week. It was a decent building in a good location. Carpets, new windows, a green park and an elementary school across the street. But the landlord dragged his heels on repairs.

Chuck confronted the stairs and prepared for a long climb. There was a gentle tremor in his legs but his cane steadied him. At the pinnacle he stopped for a breather.

“You’re too sedentary, Charles,” Doctor Li told him, a month ago in a cold office with a prairie lily painting on the wall next to a condescending poster (Shingles Can Affect Anyone!). “I’d like you to work a few minutes of exercise into your day. A walk around the block would do. Just bring your phone or Lifeline.”

He marched for apartment twenty-two and rapped on the door with his cane. Inside, he heard the sounds of sirens and hysteria. When nobody answered, he knocked louder. Then again.

“Hey!”

The door opened. A young woman with screaming green hair and metal spikes in her nose and jeans up to her bellybutton emerged with a smile.

“Hi Mister Boulevard!”

“You’re being loud.”

“You can hear that? Sorry. Having a few friends over.”

He peered over her shoulder and saw people dancing. He saw bottles of Smirnoff and stacks of red plastic cups.

“Do you know what time it is?”

“Uh, 7:30? On a Friday?”

“I’m trying to relax. You’re disturbing me.”

“My bad. We’ll keep it down.”

She yelled into the apartment. “Turn it down a peg!”

From out of the chaos, someone gave a thumbs up. Chuck detected no difference in the volume. His ears were still good. Even Li signed off on that.

“Do you have to work tomorrow or something?” she asked.

Mockery.

“I’m retired.”

He straightened his posture and felt a pinch in his rear. Sciatica.

“Just keep the fucking music down.”

“Wow. Okay.”

That was too much. There would be accusations of indecency. His reputation in the building was on the line. But he felt entitled to the final word.

“Good. I won’t have to call the landlord.”

He marched away before she could close the door in his face.

Halfway down the stairs he realized he’d left his Lifeline in the apartment. He tried to lean back and keep his center of gravity tilted away from the abyss.

He made it to his door but the knob refused to twist. He squeezed and heaved. It wouldn’t give. He was locked out. His keys, Lifeline, and iPhone were inside. He’d have to call the landlord.

“Son of a bitch.”

His second voyage to apartment twenty-two began.

The following morning, his eightieth birthday, Chuck Boulevard woke up lonely and starved for sleep. It was past ten by the time they’d gotten a hold of the landlord, and the gymnastics carried on past eleven. Tobin Towers arrived in a dress coat and polished shoes, hair slicked.

“Probably not a great idea to leave without the Lifeline, Chuck,” he said, unlocking the door.

“I was distracted by the noise upstairs. I’m no cripple.”

“Just looking out for you, my man. Safety first. Now, gotta run. Meeting some friends for cocktails and my Porsche is in the shop so I’m Ubering.”

Greeted with an empty phone and a gray morning, feet nestled in slippers, Chuck poured some coffee, donned his glasses, and unfolded his laptop to place his grocery order. A mild tremor shook his fingers as he signed in: Password123. The process had confounded him at first, but Brittany walked him through the WestCan Grocers website and how to use it. Now he was an old hand. Apples and canned mushrooms and ground coffee beans appeared by miracle every Monday.

The first delivery driver declined his tip.

“Thanks, Mister, but I can’t take that. Policy.”

“Eh? What’s this policy shit?”

The driver shrugged.

“You unionized, son?”

“Yeah. Gotta pay fees. Big pain.”

“Pain? You ever hear of the Inco strike in 78? Lasted eight months…”

“Uh, sorry sir, I have more orders.”

Chuck attempted to drip-feed labour history to his driver over each delivery but the young fish wouldn’t bite.

He placed his order then checked CBC for the latest apocalyptic headlines.

*Two injured at QAnon rally in Vancouver.*

“In Canada?” Chuck grumbled. “Fascist crackpots.”

*Twelve dead in Memphis shooting. Suspect still at large.*

“Same old.”

*Pressure mounting to remove LGBTQ books from Manitoba Catholic Schools.*

“Hmm?”

After exhausting himself with catastrophe he checked his phone for messages. Nothing. He entered his passcode with quivering fingers and traversed his contact list for Tobin Towers.

“Yes, Chuck?” Tobin’s voice was haggard with hangover. “Locked out again?”

“No. I’d like to discuss that girl in twenty-two.”

“You mean Heather? What’s up?”

“I’ve confronted her multiple times about the noise. It’s impacting my quality of life.”

“Uh huh.”

“I pay for a certain standard of living. I’m very clean. I’ve never missed a rent payment.”

“And I love you for that, Chuck. You’re one of my best tenants.”

He felt a private swell of pride.

“Perhaps you could help me with this situation?”

“Well, here’s the thing. I wasn’t planning to let anyone know for a few weeks, but I feel like I owe you the truth.”

“I’m listening.”

“I have to raise rent. Starting in two months. Twenty-one hundred.”

This seemed like a lot for a one-bedroom apartment, but Chuck could afford it. He’d sold his house to Brittany. He still had his pension and a bit of money in mutual funds.

“Here’s the good news,” Tobin continued. “Between you and me, Heather hasn’t been great on rent. And she’s got that kid. Chances are she won’t renew her lease. If she applies, I can decline her. Single parents aren’t exactly ideal tenants.”

Chuck smiled. He could hold out for another two months.

“I understand.”

“Let’s keep this between us, Chuck. Last thing I need is the ORT up my ass. Anyway, I gotta pick up my Porsche.”

“It’s my birthday,” Chuck blurted out, not knowing why.

“No shit? Happy birthday, my man! Thirty-nine?”

“Ha… What about the elevator?”

“On it. Take care, birthday boy.”

Chuck checked his notifications for something from Brittany. Still nothing.

He returned to the recliner with his coffee and grabbed his Road to Wigan Pier. Tiny footsteps began thudding circles up above. Heather raised her voice. Then there was crying.

Days like these made him wonder if selling the house was a mistake. But getting around a four-bedroom had become too difficult. He couldn’t manage daily climbs up and down the stairs. Brittany helped him find a ground-floor rental where he’d ride it out. Tobin agreed to install bars in the washroom.

He unfolded Wigan Pier and tried to ignore the tantrum while Orwell showed him around Yorkshire.

*** 

Brittany didn’t call until eight that night. Chuck was hurt.

“Dad! I’m so sorry, I totally forgot! Happy birthday! I didn’t wake you, did I?”

The ceiling was crying again. Had been for twenty minutes.

“Can’t sleep around here anyway,” Chuck said. His metamorphosis into an old curmudgeon was nearly complete.

“Neighbors still noisy? Have you considered another building?”

“Oh, the building’s fine. Library’s down the street. Doctor Li is close. Besides, I don’t have another move in me.”

“I’m really, really sorry I couldn’t make it to Saskatoon. Kaylee fell off the swings. She’s in an ankle brace.”

“It’ll heal. Remember when she fell down the stairs? That would’ve killed a stuntman.”

“She landed on her neck. I’ll have nightmares about that forever.”

“Is she there?”

“One moment… sweetie, want to talk to Grampy?”

The little voice appeared and filled Chuck’s ears with magic.

“Happy birthday, Grampy!”

“Thank you, little tiger. You hurt yourself? How’s second grade?”

“It’s good. I drew a turkey.”

“You drew a picture of yourself?”

“Grampy, no! I can show you on Facetime.”

“Eh? Oh yeah… let me see if I can do that…”

After four minutes of touchscreen warfare he was ready to flush his phone down the toilet. By the time he was looking at Kaylee she was yawning for bed. Her turkey was a superb tangle of crayon lines.

“Your gift is in the mail,” Brittany told him after sending Kaylee to bed. “I’m so sorry, Dad! I promise we’ll make it up to you. We’ll visit soon.”

“Uh huh. Did you see there was a QAnon rally in B.C.? Fascist crackpots! This is how it started in Germany, you know. First it’s rallies, then…”

“Definitely. Gotta go, Dad! Happy birthday! Love you!”

Chuck finished Wigan Pier the next day. He decided to honor Doctor Li’s directive and walk to the library. Armed with his trusty cane, he made sure he had his keys before leaving.

The sign on the elevator hadn’t gone anywhere.

It was sunny. The leaves had turned red and orange and brown. The school playground across the street was quiet. The library was only two blocks of smooth sidewalk away.

While standing on the corner, a truck drove past flying six Canadian flags and plastered with stickers decrying the federal government.

“Fascists.”

In the library, he deposited his book in the return slot and began browsing. After Orwell he was in the mood for something light. Grisham, maybe, or Matheson.

He rested his cane against the shelf and pulled out a Dan Brown novel. The first few pages were nauseating.

“Freemason crackpot.”

When he reached to put it back a tremor rocked his wrists and the book fell from his hands.

“Damn it.”

He looked at his shoes and steadied himself for the bend. Then a small pair of hands appeared and grabbed the book for him.

“Here, Mister.”

Chuck assessed the good Samaritan. A young boy, Kaylee’s age perhaps. He looked familiar.

The burning green hair flickered.

“Oh, hey Mister Boulevard.”

The Heather girl.

Chuck took the book. “Thanks.”

Slow and steady, he returned it to its place.

“Sorry about the other night,” Heather said. “I’m working two jobs. Don’t get a lot of free time. Needed to blow off some steam.”

“Uh huh.”

She had two Hoover novels tucked under her arm.

“You read much?”

“When I can,” she said. “I squeeze it in on my breaks. I’m a fast reader.”

The boy held up one of those Rowling books with the lighting-bolt kid on the front.

“I’ve read Philosopher's Stone four times! Do you know what Harry Potter is?”

“Son, I’m eighty years old. That’s after my time.”

“I like Hagrid!”

“What’s Hagrid?”

The kid revved his engines. “He’s the Hogwarts groundskeeper! He has a huge beard and wants a pet dragon and he takes care of magical animals! There’s a three-headed dog and a giant spider in the Chamber of Secrets! And a basilisk! Which is a huge snake that tries to eat Ginny!”

Chuck was lost. He needed to consult Kaylee.

Heather took the little fish by the hand. “Quiet voice in the library, Trevor. We shouldn’t bother Mister Boulevard. Why don’t you see if there’s a copy of The Hunger Games?”

Trevor took off.

“He’s probably too young for it,” Heather said. “But I’m trying to get him into something other than Potter. I don’t mind the books but I’m fed up with Rowling’s politics.”

“How so?”

“She’s not exactly an LGBTQ ally. I have a few non-binary friends. I want to support them.”

“You mean gay?”

“Non-binary. Queer. Like, people who don’t identify as the gender they were assigned at birth?”

“Huh?”

“You know what, don’t worry about it.”

Trevor returned waving another Potter book. “I found Prisoner of Azkaban!”

Heather sighed. “Well, alright. Let’s go, sweetie, before we miss the bus. We need to hit the grocery store before mommy works tonight. See you, Mister Boulevard.”

She took Trevor’s hand and pulled him towards the librarian’s desk.

“Wait…” Chuck said.

Heather stopped. “Hmm?”

“You ever used grocery delivery?”

“Um, no.”

“WestCan Grocers has a service. You can shop online. They’ll bring it to your door. There’s a fee, and sometimes you get old produce, but it’s convenient.”

“You don’t say.”

“My daughter showed me how to do it. They bring it in plastic crates, so it’s environmentally friendly. And they’re unionized.”

“Unionized, huh? Wouldn’t that be nice. You said WestCan Grocers? I’ll have to check them out. Might save me some bus rides.”

Then they were gone. Chuck was disappointed the conversation came to end. He returned to his apartment and placed a phone call.

*** 
The next night, after his grocery delivery came, Chuck slipped an old book from his shelf, grabbed his Lifeline, and began another mountain-climbing expedition to the second floor.

He was about to knock on twenty-two when Heather appeared behind him.

“Mister Boulevard?”

She was jogging up the stairs dressed in a black waitress’s outfit.

“Sorry, I thought you were home.”

“Is Trevor being loud?”

Chuck hesitated. It had sounded like a war was being waged above his head.

“No,” Chuck lied. “I only thought he might find this interesting.”

Hand shaking, he offered his copy of Charlie and the Chocolate Factory.

Heather took it. “Isn’t this a movie?”

“Yes. They changed the name to Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory. U.S. troops in ‘Nam were referring to the Viet Cong as Charlie at the time. Also, they changed the Oompa-Loompas to little green-and-orange men because… well, you’ll see.”

“Huh.”

“Roald Dahl had some shameful politics. No better than Rowling’s BGTV thing, really. But it’s the only children’s book I have. Unless Trevor likes P.G. Wodehouse.”

“Peegee who?”

“Never mind.”

“Okay, thanks. I’ll see how he likes Wonka. What kid doesn’t love candy, right?”

Chuck hobbled back to the infernal stairs while Heather fussed with her keys.

“Oh, one other thing,” he said.

“Yeah?”

He hesitated again, considering how he’d sold her out. He had to make it right.

“I spoke with Towers the other day.”

“Look, I already apologized about the noise.”

“No, not that. I was harassing him about the elevator. He gave me unfortunate news.”

“Uh oh…”

“You didn’t hear this from me, but he’s going to increase the rent. Twenty-one hundred.”

Her mouth fell open. “Are you kidding?”

“Thought you should have some notice.”

“Fuck my life.”

“Not that it’s my business, but this would be a burden for you?”

She shrugged. “I’ll probably have to move. Should’ve known this place was too swanky. I just wanted Trevor to be in a nice school.”

Chuck frowned.

“Thanks for the warning. I’m going to see if he’ll let me put on Vanderpump and pass out.”

***

Chuck called Tobin the next day.

“Chuck, if this is about the elevator, I’ve got guys coming tomorrow.”

Like hell.

“The sooner the better, but I’m not calling about that.”

“What now? More problems with Heather?”

Trevor’s footsteps thundered in the ceiling sky. He was throwing a fit again.

“No. We sorted that out. I’d like to discuss the rent increase.”

“Hate to do it. It’s the market, my man. I’ve got a few mortgages.”

“I’ve reconsidered my position on Heather’s lease. That wasn’t my business.”

“I see. Why the change of heart?”

“I placed a phone call to the Office of Residential Tenancies. They had some interesting things to say about discrimination.”

Tobin was quiet for a few seconds.

“Are you fucking with me?”

“Not at all. I think we should discuss an exemption.”

“You’re joking right? You want me to give you a break?”

“Not for me. Heather. She’d benefit from another year at a maintained rate.”

Frantic footsteps zipped across the ceiling.

Chuck sighed. “Her son attends a school nearby.”

“Fine. Have it your way, Charles. I won’t be listening to any more noise complaints. We keep the ORT out of this?”

“On one condition.”

“What’s that?”

“Fix the damn elevator.”

Chuck hung up and the doorbell rang.

He hobbled on arthritic knees and opened the door to a Canada Post worker bearing a square package.

“Mister Boulevard? Need a signature.”

The pen shook in Chuck’s hand. He dropped it as he was scribbling. After the postman retrieved it for him, all he could manage was a wavy scratch.

He closed the door and set the package on his kitchen table. Holding scissors like a surgeon, he sliced away the paper.

A birthday card waited inside: Happy birthday, Dad! Love Brittany and Kaylee.

He assessed his gift. Soundproof headphones.
