Ted Labour roasted alive in his lawn chair. He sat in the middle of his yard, the heart of paradise, shielded only by sunglasses and undersized swim trunks, sweat streaming over his rounded belly, beer cans empty at his feet. His radio blared rock music and ads for used cars and no-questions-asked cash loans.  

“You’re gonna get cancer.”  

Ted ignored her.  

“Your yard is fucked. You need to clean it before you die of heatstroke.”  

“Leave it, you bag.”  

“Turn your damn music down.”  

He sat up, peeling his hairy back from the chair, and peered through a drunken haze at his nemesis.  

“You hear me, Labour? Turn it down or I’ll call the cops.”  

Loraine Lafleur. Blight of Jordan Village, cousin of the feral hog. She hunched over the chain link fence that divided their territory, cigarette dangling from her mouth, clutching a fistful of lotto scratch tickets, flabby skin pouring from her freckled shoulders.  

“Who’s gonna get cancer, you chain-smoking cow?”  

She glared and flicked her butt across the fence, where it fell smoking at his toes. He crushed it barefoot without a flinch.  

“Your radio’s too damn loud,” she said, raking one of her tickets with an oversized artificial nail.  

“It’s the middle of the day.”  

He fished a fresh beer from his melting cooler.  

“Get a job already,” Loraine said. “Look at you. Look at your yard.”  

Ted fell back into his chair.  

“What about it?”  

“It’s full of shit.”  

He saw nothing wrong with his yard. In the corner rested two rusted cars with no wheels and no windows and no engines. Next to them, a stack of flat tires. Next to them, his lawn mowers. Beyond, mountains of paint cans. Thirty yards of chain, a mile of coiled garden hose. A bathtub, a recliner, a canoe, a washing machine, a dishwasher, a power washer, a wheelbarrow. Three ladders. Sacks of grass-seed, weed killer, and fertilizer. Rakes, shovels, spades, buckets, a tamper, a hacksaw, a mitre saw, a jigsaw, a table saw, a chainsaw. A leaf blower and a snowblower and a blowtorch. All useful. All good for parts. Ted wasted nothing.  

“One of these days the city’s gonna ticket you.”  

“One of these days.”  

“I’ll call the cops.”  

“Why don’t you call your divorce lawyer?”  

A radio ad for online blackjack made way for the Eagles. But before the doors of Hotel California opened, there was a violent hiss and silence took the yard.  

Loraine’s lighter clicked.  

“Your radio’s dead, Ted.”  

It sat by the door, overworked and off-duty. She huffed and blew a jetstream of smoke over the fence.  

“Finally, some peace and quiet.”  

“Fuck off, Loraine.”  

“Fuck off, Ted.”  

***  

Afternoon ruined, Ted took his cooler and radio and retreated into his trailer.  

Outside the kitchen window, the enemy prowled her habitat. The jungle of Loraine’s yard swarmed with gardens, planters, and flower beds. She grew everything. Potatoes, radishes, onions, garlic, tomatoes. She grew rose bushes and orchards and wheat fields and rainforests. A provincial park worth of vegetation crammed into one trailer park lot.  

She thought her leaves and vines and emerald-green grass made her better than him. She was preoccupied. Probably obsessive compulsive and in urgent need of friends.  

Ted’s open laptop was idling on a *jobs.com* page, a neglected task he’d intended to return to after his backyard bake. A blinking bulletin waited with vacancies for bus drivers and forklift drivers, for security guards, for hedge trimmers, lawn cutters, and meter-minders. For car washers, dishwashers, and window washers. Most required minimal experience and offered minimum wage at minimal hours, with minimal benefits and minimal room for growth. But the employment insurance was shrinking and inflation was growing.  

First he had to address his electrical failure. He assessed his radio and formed a hypothesis: the battery was dead. Confident that a replacement hid nearby, he went through the drawers and cupboards and closets and toolboxes and plastic bins. No batteries.  

Outside, a white truck was pulling up next door.  

His other neighbor, the soft-spoken and contemplative Lee Beavers, was guiding two sleeveless young men wearing flip flops and Bass Pro Shop hats as they carried a cabinet down the front steps and into their truck.  

“Thanks a lot, Beavers,” they said, climbing into the cab.  

Lee waved. “Take care.”  

Ted sauntered out as the truck bounced away. “Whaddya know, Lee? You downsizing?”  

“Need new glasses. Insurance only covers thirty percent.”  

“You get a good deal? Where’d you meet those punks?”  

“Kijiji. How’s your leg?”  

“Not bad. Still a bit stiff. Hurts when it rains. Might be a while before I can work again, but there’s still some EI in the tank.”  

“Hm.”  

“Anyway, my radio died while Loraine was giving me shit. She threw a dart on my lawn. What a bitch, eh?”  

Lee shrugged.  

“You got any batteries? I’ll give you ten bucks for a couple of nine-volts.”  

“One second.”  

Lee went inside while Ted stood guard on the front step, shoulders peeling and blistering. The sun had the sky to itself. He loved the summer.  

Across the road, a 95 Oldsmobile pulled up bearing Joe Beard. Joe heaved out of his chariot, short of breath, wide in all directions, packed into a sweat-drenched 3X dress shirt, circular glasses sliding down his nose, tie dangling, A\&W bag in hand.  

Ted waved.  

“Whaddya know, Joe?”  

“Good afternoon!”  

Joe chugged across the dirt road separating their trailers.  

Ted clapped him on the shoulder. “How was church?”  

“Oh, lovely. I’m organizing a food and clothing drive. If you have non-perishables to spare, anything helps.”  

“Sure. I’ve got loads. Lentils and chickpeas. Always think I’m gonna make soup. Never get around to it. Frozen dinners are easier. I’ll bring you a crate.”  

“St. Nicholas Parish appreciates your generosity. And thanks for fixing my sink last weekend. I’m worse than useless when it comes to plumbing.”  

“Don’t mention it. What are neighbors for? You’re good shit, Joe.”  

“How’s your job hunt?” Joe asked. “There are some fellows at the church who could use a handy guy like you. I could pass on your resume if you like.”  

“Oh, uh… Nah. Thanks, Joe. Leg’s still a bit stiff. Don’t want to rush, you know? Might reinjure it.”  

Lee emerged empty-handed.  

“Sorry. No batteries.”  

“Thanks for looking, Lee.”  

Lee smiled at Joe. “How are ya?”  

“Very well, thanks\! Up for a rematch soon? You’dve had the last game if you’d held that knight.”  

“Sure thing. I’ve been practicing my late game.”  

“Joe here is doing the Lord’s work, collecting for the needy,” Ted said. “Whaddya say, Lee? Got any canned goods in there?”  

“One second.”  

“Lee’s good shit,” Ted said, as he vanished again. “I’m trying to track down some nine-volts. Radio’s dead. That chain-smoking bitch Loraine was breaking my balls earlier.”  

Joe frowned. “You really ought to make peace. She’s very generous, and she grows wonderful vegetables. *Let each of us please his neighbor for his good, to build him up.* Romans, 15:2.”  

“Yeah well, she ain’t got nothin’ nice to say to me. George Thorogood, 1977.”  

Lee returned bearing three cans of ready-made stew.  

“Here you go.”  

“I believe I have some spare batteries you could have,” Joe said.

Ted held the cans while Joe fished through his bottomless pockets for his front door keys. The arrangement inside was prim and minimalist. A sofa with a canyon in the middle seat, a chessboard, a crucifix above the sink, a shelf where the Holy Bible was cramped next to Hemingway, Atwood, chess strategy, and motivators titled *Lose It\!* and *Conquer the Cravings* and *The Person You Want To Be*.  

Joe set his A\&W on the counter and pulled a pack of Duracells from a kitchen drawer.  

“Thanks a million, Joe. Ten bucks?”  

“Oh heavens, no. They’ve been sitting there forever. They’re all yours.”  

“You’re good shit. I’ll bring the cans around after supper.”  

***  

Ted forgot about the lentils and the chicpeas and fell asleep on his couch with the radio on, surrounded by crumpled beer cans. Screaming blue and red lights jolted him awake in the night. He blinked through a sledging headache and shambled to the window.  

There was an ambulance outside Joe’s place.  

“Fuck me\!”  

He ran outside in his underwear. Lee Beavers was already out, watching a squad of medics extract a stretcher down Joe’s front steps.  

“What the hell? Talk to me, Lee.”  

Lee shook his head gravely.  

“It’s Joe.”  

“What happened?”  

“Stroke, maybe. Or a heart attack.”  

“Jesus Christ. Is he okay?”  

“I’m afraid not.”  

***  

The funeral was held at St. Nicholas Parish two days later. Ted stuffed himself into his only dress shirt, bottom four buttons bulging, and checked YouTube for a tie-tying tutorial. He’d barely slept. He was trapped in a multi-day hangover. His headache boiled and hissed beneath a sun that insisted on shining.  

He dropped a crate of cans into the back of Lee’s Chevy, next a bundle of the coveralls Lee wore to the hospital, and they drove to the funeral together.  

“It’s bullshit man,” Ted said, as they passed the sign that read *Jordan Village Mobile Homes*. “I mean what the hell? How is a guy standing there one moment then stroking out a few hours later?”  

“It’s not right.”  

Billboard ads for fast food and the Saskatchewan government’s promises of prosperity glided by the side of the road, then a bulletin depicting a sedan crumpled in the ditch with bold block lettering: *Report Impaired Drivers.*  

“Thanks for driving,” Ted said.  

“When do you get your license back?”  

“Next year. Hopefully.”  

His own truck, packed with the brushes, rollers, ladders, and buckets of paint from his last job hadn’t left the driveway since a trip home from the pool hall last winter took him through a checkstop.  

Outside the church doors, Ted stood frozen with his non-perishable payload straining his arms.  

“You alright?” Lee asked.  

“You go to church much?”  

Lee shook his head.  

“Neither. I don’t know the rules. How’s my breath?”  

Lee pulled a pack of gum from his pocket.  

“Take this.”  

Ted brought his crate to the first usher he spotted: a young woman, four feet tall in heels, suited in gray, hair swirled in a bun.  

“I brought these. I’m Ted Labour. Joe said there was a food drive. Do I bring these straight to the priest?”  

“Oh… thank you. I can take them.”  

She nearly capsized as he dumped sixty pounds into her arms.  

“Be careful with those. They’re non-perishable and very heavy.”  

She shuffled away with her oversized load as people trickled through the doors.  

“The middle of the church is called the nave,” Ted told Lee. “I looked that up online.”  

“Interesting. When do we go in?”  

“Not sure. Let’s wait it out. Women and children first, probably.”  

He rocked on his feet, hands in his pockets, watching the gentle crowds who’d come to bid Joe farewell. Loraine lumbered through the church doors and he felt his hungover guts melt into slime.  

“What are you doing here?”  

She scowled. “It’s a funeral. What do you think I’m doing here? Your breath is fucked.”  

“Your perfume is fucked. Did you even bring any non-perishable food items?”  

“As a matter of fact…”  

The breathless popsicle-stick usher returned, sweating, and encouraged them to quietly enter the nave and find a seat.  

“Is it assigned seating?” Ted asked.  

“There’s some space reserved for the family near the front. Otherwise, please feel free to sit anywhere.”  

He was dismayed to find all the good seats taken. He and Lee and Loraine had to squeeze into the nosebleed section.  

“I’m surprised you came sober,” she hissed at him.  

“I’m surprised you didn’t burst into flames when you walked through the door.”  

There was lunch in the churchyard following the service. Lee and Ted hovered with styrofoam coffee cups, nodding at their fellow mourners. A short, thick fellow with a shining bald spot and Popeye forearms was making the rounds. He shook Ted’s hand like a trash compactor.  

“Stock Owens,” he said. “Thanks for coming.”  

“Ted Labour.”  

“Lee Beavers.”  

Stock nodded. “You’re Ted? Joe mentioned you a few weeks ago. Said you might be in the market for a job.”  

“Uh, I’m shrugging off an injury right now. Fell off a ladder while I was painting.”  

“Damn,” Stock pulled a business card from his suit jacket. “Two of our young guns are heading back to school this fall. Call me when you’re ready to get back on the horse. Joe vouched for you.”  

Ted took the card: *Stock’s Hauling.*  

“Thanks.”  

“Hope we can schedule an interview soon. Take care.”  

He stuffed it into his wallet as Stock carried on breaking fingers.  

“I need something to do with my hands,” he said to Lee, eyeballing the checkered picnic tables. “You hungry?”  

“Starving.”  

They assessed the spread. Sandwiches, salads, brownies, lemonade, cookies, trays of carrots and celery and cauliflower and sugar snap peas. Ted skipped the veggies and heaped some potato salad onto a paper plate with a stack of roast beef sandwiches gushing with mustard.  

“Look at all these people,” Ted said through a forkful. “I can’t imagine this many people at *my* funeral. Maybe I should \- holy shit… this potato salad is amazing. Who made this?”  

“I did.” Loraine appeared, cigarette pinched in her claws. “So what?”  

“You bought this from a store.”  

“It’s my own recipe.”  

“Liar. Did you even know Joe?”  

“Of course I did. Genius chess player. Very well read. We…” She stopped and sniffed. “We talked about starting a book club. Damn it\!”  

She pulled a napkin from her pocket and dabbed glistening eyes. Ted felt a lump in his throat. Joe in a book club? Generous and tactical and literate. Taken from Jordan Village before his time.  

“Are you okay?” Lee asked.  

Lorraine sniffed. “I’m fine.”  

“I meant Ted.”  

Ted coughed. “Me? I’m good. It’s the onions in the potato salad. Stop crying, you’re embarrassing Lee.”  

“You’re such a moron,” Loraine said.  

“Listen,” He stood straight, rolled his shoulders back, asserting himself with posture, and prepared the conversation-ending retort. Then three buttons snapped off his bulging dress shirt, exposing his hairy bellybutton.  

Ted set his plate down and sought privacy.  

***  

Two days after the funeral, Ted sat in his backyard with a beer while his brain hissed like bacon. He’d left the radio inside and listened to the lawn mowers and barking dogs and bouncing basketballs of Jordan Village, now one citizen emptier. Joe Beard, chess master, was in his thoughts.  

Loraine came outside to fill her watering can.  

“Get a job yet?”  

“Leave it. I don’t want to smell your cigarettes.”  

“I quit smoking.”  

“You… what?”  

She exposed her arm, plastered with patches.  

“I’m getting healthy. Some of us care about our bodies.”  

“Bullshit.”  

“I haven’t smoked since Joe’s funeral. How many beers have you had today?”  

He slid his can into the cooler.  

“None. It’s kombucha.”  

She doused her tomato plants and her bean sprouts.  

“I should start a pool. What will Ted Labour die of? Skin cancer or a fatty liver?”  

“Leave it.”  

He slid off his chair and fled inside. Quit smoking? She was screwing with him.  

His funeral dress shirt lay crumpled on the couch, three-buttons short. Clutter in a cluttered home. He thought of Joe’s place, neat and tidy, with space to breathe and move and live. Perhaps this scythe-swipe from the angel of death was an omen. A warning from heaven. It was time Ted mended his ways and found the righteous path. Return to the ranks of the employed. Restore function to his lungs. Shrink his gut and lower his resting heart rate. He’d do a way better job than Loraine. Then he could sit in his yard in peace while she smoked her way through the cemetery gates.  

He donned a T-shirt and prepared himself for a walk to the corner store. He needed salad and mineral water.  

Out front, Lee was lacing up a pair of sneakers.  

“Nice shoes, Terry Fox.”  

“Thanks. I’m going for a run.”  

“Everyone’s on a health kick around here. Since when do you run?”  

Lee shrugged and pulled foot behind his knee, stretching his quads. “It’s been a while. Did some running in college.”  

“I’m getting into shape as well. Quitting drinking. Well, cutting back. I’m into salad now. I was a hell of an offensive lineman back in high school. They called me Ted the Dread. Gonna start hitting the weights again soon.”  

“Good plan.”  

Lee lunged and jogged in place, preparing for liftoff.  

“I’m gonna hit the store and grab some kale. Watch the knees.”  

***  

That night, after choking down a miserable tangle of leaves and carrots and cucumber, Ted unfolded his laptop and prepared to downsize. He posted ads for some of his old tools: pipe wrenches and electric drills and carpentry hammers. He made peace with his unwillingness to pick up the guitar in the living room corner. He was never going to fit into his old suit jacket. Did he really need three weed-whackers?  

He tossed his prehistoric stack of Jerry Springer era TV guides, along with an old VCR and DVD player and portable stereo. He auctioned his *National Lampoon* and *Dumb & Dumber* tapes on ebay. He purged bottle openers, ping pong paddles, hockey sticks, fishing rods, tents, portable heaters, fire-starters. He emptied containers of cables, buckets of bolts, screws, and nails.  

Over the next few days college kids and single parents and collectors trickled up and down his front steps to give him handfuls of cash eight, ten, thirty, sixty bucks at a time. The size of his home grew as he unearthed surfaces and corners that had spent years hidden from sunlight.  

Then he stuffed some old clothes into garbage bags and gave Lee twenty bucks to drive them to St. Nicholas Parish. Old trousers, Hawaan shirts, loafers, graphic tees, oversized sweats, football jerseys, raincoats and long underwear. He reclaimed dresser space and closet real estate.  

Stock Owens’s business card remained tucked in his wallet.  

After a productive trading campaign, Ted felt like he’d earned a drink. Beneath the purple-pink swirl of twilight he wandered to the SK Beverages offsale by the gas-station at the border of Jordan Village. A sign was taped to the door: *Machine Down. Cash Only.*  

He dipped into the fluorescent glow of QuickGas in search of an ATM, where he encountered his mortal enemy, Loraine, hunched in front of the till.  

“Give me four Blackjacks and a Plinko,” she said, tapping the scratch tickets beneath the counter glass. “And a twenty of Marlboros.”  

“I knew it\!”  

She turned, caught in the act, caught on tape under the blinking light of the corner security camera.  

“These aren’t for me\!” she said. “I’m grabbing them for my niece.”  

“Like hell. I knew you couldn’t quit. You don’t have what it takes.”  

“And what, you stopped in for a pack of gum?”  

“I came here for, uh… soup.”  

“Bullshit. The machine is down in the offsale and you’re here for cash.”  

“You see any beer? You’re the one smoking.”  

The red-headed cashier, pockmarked with acne, was filming them on his phone.  

“I didn’t smoke shit. Give me the damn scratchers, kid.”  

She slunk out the door with her ransom notes.  

High on victory, Ted shoved seven cans of coke and a bottle of sunscreen into a basket. How did that Catholic nursery rhyme go? *Lead us not into temptation*. He walked home with chin held high, knowing Joe would be proud.  

***  

The next day, slicked with sunscreen, green Rider cap protecting his noggin from the harmful ultraviolet rays, Ted Labour barbequed hot dogs. He waved at Lee, who was sweating out his second lap around Jordan Village, paying his tribute to chessmaster Joe Beard.  

 Eager to do his part, Ted drank sugar-free no-name bubbly water that forced him to the toilet every seven minutes. He drank non-alcoholic beer from Sobey’s that tasted like feet. He drank energy drinks and zero-calorie soda and iced tea and iced coffee. He was crazed for booze, carbonated, bubbly, bitter in the best way, that made the sun shine brighter and spiked the dullness of Jordan life.  

Loraine slimed out of her trailer, sweat-soaked, tomato-red, hair clipped high, minutes from death, and began beating her air conditioner.  

“Son of a god damn bitch…”  

She smacked and slapped and kicked.  

He smiled. “Got yourself a mechanical issue?”  

“Fuck off, Ted. Air conditioner’s broken.”  

“Damn. It’s a scorcher.”  

The temperature was thirty-nine degrees; an environment suitable only for cobras and dung-beetles.  

“I’m gonna have to call the guy,” Loraine said.  

“The guy’s gonna rip you off. This is why you’re broke. You can’t do anything for yourself.”  

“You’re the one with no job. I’ve seen all that shit you’re selling. Money must be tight.”  

“I’ve got tons of money. I’m just downsizing. I have three bitcoins. But I feel sorry for you, and you were in Joe’s good books, so I’ll fix your air conditioner. Fifty bucks.”  

“You’ll make it worse. Thirty bucks.”  

“Forty and some potato salad. And I want lemonade.”  

“Fine.”  

First, he hit it with the multimeter.  

“She’s got juice. Kill the breaker. Let’s see what’s going on under there.”  

He spent the rest of his barebacked afternoon with magma pouring down his spine, hunched over Lorainne’s air conditioner with his tool box unfolded and his fingers greased with WD40.  

“Here’s your first problem,” he said when he yanked out the soot-black corpse of a filter.   

It felt good to use his hands, to twist screws and tighten bolts, even if he was working for one of Lucifer’s closest advisors. He brushed down the grime-encrusted condenser coils and snaked a few gallons of filth out of the drain line.  

The human vulture porch-perched over him, chewing whole packs of nicotine gum at once.  

“You done yet?”  

“It’ll be done when it’s done,” Ted said, picking his nose with his pliers.. “Can’t you piss off inside or something?”  

“It’s a pressure cooker in there. Hurry the hell up. Christ. I could use a cigarette.”  

He'd gone through three pitchers of lemonade that had done nothing to curb his bubbly cravings. But he couldn’t let her win.  

“You have no willpower,” he said. “That’s why you’ll never get anywhere in life.”  

“Means a lot coming from an unemployed alcoholic. How about we forget the potato salad. How about I buy you a six pack instead?”  

Be strong.  

“We’re doing it for Joe.”  

He surprised himself. He meant to say *I’m* doing it for Joe.  

Loraine chewed. “I miss him.”  

Ted pushed himself to his feet and kicked the toolbox closed. “Flip our breaker on. This thing’s coming back.”  

The air conditioner roared to life like a freight train.  

He packed up his tools. “You owe me forty bucks. And some potato salad.”  

She peeled four tens from her back pocket and slapped them in his sweaty palm.  

“I’ll bring the salad around in a few hours. Now get the hell off my property.”  

Later on the couch, Ted sat with Stock Owens’s business card in one hand and his phone in the other. He found himself unable to call. Too proud. Or perhaps too ashamed. The pursuit of new work in middle age was diminishing. The need to do it made him feel lesser.  

Loraine brought the salad shortly after six.  

“‘Bout time.”  

“Don’t be a prick.”  

She peered over his shoulder.  

“Jesus, what happened?” she said. “Looks like an actual home in here.”  

“Leave it. None of your business.”  

“I haven’t smoked in a week, you know.”  

“Good for you. I’m off beer. And I can do ten pushups.”  

“I started doing yoga.”  

“I’m going to church.”  

“No you’re not.”  

“Well I’m going to. This Sunday. Joe and I will be laughing while you burn in hell.”  

“Whatever. Enjoy the salad, fatass.”  

“Get off my porch, whore.”  

***

He ate the entire bowl of potato salad for dinner. There were portions enough for three or four meals, but the potato train had no brakes. He pushed away the empty bowl and leaned back in his chair.  

With no potato salad to distract him, with no beer to crack, his attention fell on the business card. It was almost six-thirty, not too late for a phone call.  

He dialed.  

“Stock here.”  

“Ted Labour. Sorry to get you after dinner.”  

“Not at all. You got a resume for me?”  

“I can send it tomorrow.”  

“Good man. Email’s on the card. We’ll talk soon.”  

Ted hung up. He was committed now. He cracked his laptop and opened his sad-looking job history. It seemed insufficient in every way, and he didn’t know what to add, but he had Joe Beard’s respected word behind him. It could be enough.  

He shut his laptop, vowing to follow through.  

He laid flat in bed at ten o’clock. The breath of the oscillating fan was unable to settle his dry, crowded mind. His thoughts were of Joe Beard, the fallen saint of Jordan Village, and of beer. He’d heard there were five stages of grief. He was in the craving stage. A mild buzz would do it.  

The clock’s glowing digits read 10:07. SK Beverages would be open. Would it be so wrong to indulge? Cold turkey may have been rash. He expected too much of himself. Even Saint Beard had his vices. Even the church served wine.  

Baby steps, he thought, as he found himself pulling on sweats and tying sneakers. First a job. Continue downsizing. There was plenty of time to work on his health.  

He slipped out his front door. In the dim porch light he saw Lee's running shoes lying unused beneath the front step. Ted hurried down the road, too afraid to gaze into darkened windows of Joe’s trailer for fear that the trailer would gaze back into him.  

He stopped on the perimeter of QuickGas to assess the risk of a Loraine ambush. No trace. He snuck into the offsale, a place he’d done business hundreds of times but now seemed like forbidden ground. The transaction felt criminal. The six-pack he brought home felt like a case of stolen diamonds.  

Unwilling to waste the night’s warmth, he parked himself on the back porch. As he cracked the first can the cancerous stench of burning tobacco drifted across the yard. Loraine, still as a gargoyle, stood on her porch smoking a cigarette.  

A fellow fallen soldier. Spared from failing in solitude.  

Their eyes met through the village quiet. In the moonlit dark he saw her nod at him. He raised a beer. She put her smoke out and returned inside. Ted drank in peace.
